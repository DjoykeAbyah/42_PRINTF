# ft_printf 🖨️

## Description 📝

This is a recode of the famous `printf` function from the `libc` library. 
The objective was to create a library called `libftprintf.a`, which contains my own implementation of the `ft_printf` function.

## Requirements 📋

The `printf` function had to meet the following requirements:

- **Conversions**: My`ft_printf` function should handle the following conversions: `c`, `s`, `p`, `d`, `i`, `u`, `x`, `X`, and `%`.
- **Buffer Management**: No implementation of the buffer management of the original `printf`.
- **Comparison**: My function was compared against the original `printf`.

## Exploration and Learning 📚🌱

Through this assignment, I had the opportunity to explore and master the following areas:

- Programming skills improvement 💪
- Variadic functions in C 🌟
- Code structure and extensibility 🏗️

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the program using the provided Makefile by simply running:

```$ make```


## Usage
Run the following command to execute:

```$ make test```
